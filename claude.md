### 2. DORA Metrics & Developer Experience Platform
**Path**: `/projects/dora-devex/`

**Story Arc**: Transforming engineering visibility from zero to complete deployment intelligence

**3 Integrated Components**:
1. **DORA Metrics Collector** (Python):
   - Correlates GitOps repos, Bitbucket API, Jira API, ArgoCD API
   - Exposes 15+ Prometheus metrics
   - Tracks 413 deployments/month, lead times, deployment frequency

2. **Pipeline Reporter** (Bash - 1000+ lines):
   - Rich Teams Adaptive Cards with smart routing
   - 4 channels: Platform Deployments, Security, PR Notifications, QA
   - Easter eggs for build milestones and time-based messages
   - ArgoCD/Veracode/Jira deep linking

3. **Deployment Gates** (Bash):

- **Logs**: Loki (microservices mode) + Promtail
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager (50+ rules, Teams integration)
- **Exporters**: Node, Kube State Metrics, Kafka, Postgres, Redis, CloudWatch

**Key Implementations**:
- **Alert Rules**: Node alerts (CPU/mem/disk), Kubernetes alerts (pod crashes, nodes not ready), network alerts (latency, drops), application-specific rules
- **Smart Routing**: Dev (business hours only), QA (24/7), environment-specific channels
- **Alert Inhibition**: Suppress low-severity when critical fires, node failures suppress pod alerts
- **Service Instrumentation**: All 20 services exposing custom metrics for business intelligence
- **Runbooks**: Comprehensive documentation for every alert with kubectl commands and resolution steps

**Dashboards Created**:
- Platform: Cluster health, infrastructure metrics, service mesh, database performance, Kafka health
- Service-Specific: IoT gateway intelligence (throughput, connections, vendor rankings), multi-tenant analytics, integration performance
- Business: Cost savings tracking, SLA monitoring, capacity planning

**Business Impact**: <$5K/yr cost (vs $50K-150K), 25+ dashboards, 50+ alert rules, ~70% MTTD reduction, 100% service coverage

**Technologies**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Thanos, Alertmanager, Promtail, Kubernetes, Kustomize, Istio, Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics, Kafka Exporter, S3, PromQL, LogQL

- ✅ Developer names templated ("Developer Name")
- ✅ Ticket IDs genericized (PROJ-XXXX instead of GENX-XXXX)
- ✅ URLs and AWS account numbers replaced with placeholders
- ✅ No proprietary business information exposed

## Technical Notes

### Issues Resolved
- **OneDrive/Turbopack conflict**: Turbopack disabled via `TURBOPACK=0`, installed `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- **Dark mode toggle**: Fixed positioning with `relative` class and `inset-0 m-auto` for icon overlay
- **Git divergent branches**: Reset local main to match origin/main
- **Tailwind 4.x compatibility**: Using `@tailwindcss/postcss` with proper configuration
- **Next.js 16 compatibility**: Configured turbopack as object in next.config.ts
